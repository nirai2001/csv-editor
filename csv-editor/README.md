This is a CSV Editor [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project.

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependecies from package.json:

```bash
npm i
# or
npm install
```

Then Run the nextjs application:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Note
I have provided MOCK_DATA.csv, use that for validation of the application!
